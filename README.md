# 🎓 STAT305 Group F Project
### Predicting Student Performance Using SAS and Logistic Regression

This project analyzes factors that influence student performance using **Student Performance Data A**.  
The analysis was conducted in **SAS** as part of the **STAT305 (Biostatistics)** module at **UKZN**.

---

## 📘 Objective
To identify demographic, social, and school-related factors that significantly affect a student’s likelihood of passing.

---

## 🧮 Methods
1. **Data Exploration**
   - Used `PROC FREQ` and `PROC UNIVARIATE` to summarize variables.
2. **Tests of Association**
   - Applied Chi-square tests to examine relationships between categorical predictors and the outcome.
3. **Model Building**
   - Fitted a logistic regression model using `PROC LOGISTIC`.
4. **Model Selection**
   - Removed non-significant variables based on AIC and goodness-of-fit.
5. **Interpretation**
   - Interpreted odds ratios to determine key predictors of success.

---

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Gender:** Females had a higher chance of passing.  
- **Address:** Urban students performed better than rural students.  
- **Higher Education Ambition:** Strongly associated with passing.  
- **Internet Access:** Positively influenced academic success.

---

## 🧠 Conclusion
Logistic regression showed that **personal ambition, environment, and parental education** play important roles in student outcomes.  
The model fit well with no major outliers or overdispersion.
